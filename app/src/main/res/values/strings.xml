    <string name="Introduction">FMD is an application that can help you find your phone when it gets lost.\nIt uses SMS (texting) to communicate. You need to have a second device or a friend so you can track your phone.\nJust write a SNS that contains the "fmd" command.\nStill in beta.\n\n - Nulide</string>
    <string name="UpdatePermission">Some new permissions are needed.\nPlease check the following permissions in order to continue using this app, or change back to an older version of the app.</string>
    <string name="Permission_SMS">In order to see when you tell the phone to do something, this app needs to be able to see your texts. Your texts never leave your device, and they are never used for anything except finding your phone.\nThis Permission is needed.</string>
    <string name="Permission_CONTACTS">Not everybody is allowed to wipe or locate your phone, so you need to be able to select some contacts who will be able to locate your device.\nThis permission is needed.</string>
    <string name="Permission_GPS">If you want to locate the gps coordinates from the phone, the application needs this permission. \nPlease also allow the application to locate you in the background.\nIf you don\'t give this permission, this functionality will not be activated.</string>
    <string name="Permission_DND">You also can make the phone ring so that you can find it. When DoNotDisturb is activated, it may be possible that the phone is muted.\nIf you don\'t give this permission, this functionality will not be activated.</string>
    <string name="Permission_DEVICE_ADMIN">If you want to lock or wipe your phone if it gets lost, this permission is needed.\nIf you don\'t give this permission, this functionality will not be activated.</string>
    <string name="Permission_WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS">This application is capable of turning on GPS if you normally leave GPS off.\nIn order to achieve this, the application needs a special permission that you have to grant to it with a computer.\nIf you don\'t grant this permission, it\'s no problem.\nYou can still use this application.</string>
    <string name="Permission_OVERLAY">When you remotely lock your device, this application can show a message on the lockscreen for whoever finds your phone.\nIf you don\'t give this permission, this functionality will not be activated.</string>

    <string name="About_Text">Thanks for downloading this app!\nThere is still a lot to do, but I hope this app will help you if you find yourself in the same situation I had. Losing your phone is bad, but losing your phone because there are no privacy-friendly apps to help you find it is even worse.\nContributions and donations are welcome! Just go to F-Droid and search for my app.\n\n - Nulide</string>
